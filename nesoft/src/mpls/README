Caveats for the MPLS-BGP/VPN solution provided by APN:

1. IP addresses of all Customer Edge Routers (CEs) connected to
   a Provider Edge Router (PE) are required to be global in the
   given PEs scope.


       --------
       | CE 1 | -------<>---------- 
       --------                   |
                              ----------
       --------               |        |
       | CE 2 | -------<>---- |   PE   | ---------~
       --------               |        |
                              ----------
       --------                   |
       | CE 3 | -------<>----------
       --------

   Given a scenario such as the one described above, the three CEs
   are required to have unique -- but not globally unique -- IP
   addresses.

2. If a Route Reflector is in use in a VPN scenario, the LSRs
   can only use a platform-wide label-space.

3. Inter-Provider VPN Solution is not currently supported. We currently
   support IBGP connections b/w Provider Edge Routers only.
